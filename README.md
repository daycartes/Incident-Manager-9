# Incident-Manager-9
An app helping you to manage the scene of a road accident
Rationale:
A few years ago, whilst driving in Cheshire, my wife and I happened upon an accident. It wasn’t a terrible accident but there were two occupants of a vehicle still in their car whose front end had been ripped off. We set about talking to the occupants and realised that with a bit of help they could extricate themselves from the wreckage. We managed to help them to sit away from the scene whilst waiting for the emergency personnel to arrive. We later went to hospital with them and visited them the next day and we remained in contact with them for a few years.
Previous to this incident we had had no training, so we worked more by instinct than by following a set procedure.
A few years later whilst driving for Blood Bikes Cumbria, I attended a course roughly entitled Incident Manager. It was an excellent course teaching us how to deal with an incident like the one above. It wasn’t so much an in depth course of first aid and such like but more of a course on how to take control and manage what happens at an accident.
It breaks down into various stages:
1.	Dealing with the initial scene 
2.	Recording the vehicles and personnel involved in the incident.
3.	Checking each casualty for major bleeding.
4.	The main job though is taking as many details as you can of the casualties and this is because if they are unconscious when the medics arrive you will have some details about them and their condition that, due to the condition of the casualty, the medics will be unable to ascertain.
We learned a SAMPLE acrostic:
Signs and symptoms
Allergies
Medication
Past medical history
Last eat or drink 
Events leading up to the incident.
Recently, there have been an unprecedented number of daily accidents on the M6 so the chances of being the person arriving first at the scene of an accident is not as unusual as you might think.
I gained a lot of confidence with this training. I wondered how to practically put the theory into practice so I set about designing an App.
I did this because it is fairly unlikely that you will have a pen and paper handy to jot down the information, but nearly everyone has a phone and it is fairly easy to open an App.
In designing the app I wanted to design it so that it is easy to use without a maze of routes to follow, therefore I designed it to have a simple and basic user interface.
I decided on a linear approach starting at the beginning of arriving at the incident, taking stock of the situation, recording the vehicles and personnel, a very brief instruction on checking for blood and then an adapted SAMPLE in that I have designed fields for name, age, where it hurts, allergies, medication past history, time of last eating or drinking and the events leading up to the incident. The user can fill in as many of those details as he /she may be able for up to 4 casualties. 
(If there are more casualties it might be very difficult, taking into consideration the stress of the situation, to record more than 4, so it would be better to choose the 4 most injured and take their details.) 
There is a button to save the information on the phone which you can use whilst waiting for the emergency services to arrive. In order to check that you have the correct information there is a check button at the bottom of each page of input material.
Should you feel the need to share the information with the emergency services there is a page where you can send the information by email or text.
Obviously you are dealing with personal information so this should in no circumstances be shared with anyone other than emergency services and this information should be removed from your phone before you depart the scene. This is easily accomplished on the final page of the App. The button to close the App is not enabled until you have deleted the files. 
I sincerely hope that you do not have to use this app but by downloading it for free you can rest assured that, if you are unfortunate to be first on the scene, you have a guide on what to do next.
The App is totally free to download, there are no annoying adverts, no trial  editions.
